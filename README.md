# Shell-Shock-Memory-Game
My second project will be based on a memory card game. The theme will be my favourite cartoon group known
as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive game.

# Demo
Here is the interactive demo [game](https://chikos96.github.io/shell-shock-memory-game/) 

## User Experience
    
- UX Design

This game is for user that to play games. The Memory Game is the most suitable game because the user gets to
find all the cards to match. It is fun and interactive for all users. It will be in a single page format.

### User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to click all the cards.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much time did i match my cards.
- As a user, I want to play the game again.
- As a user, i want to understand easily about the functionality of the game.

### Design
 - Color Scheme
     -   The main colors I used are green and black.
- Typography
      -  I used Cambria font style. 
- Imagery
    -  I found the image on the website to find the characters that everyone likes. 
    These images could attract the user's attention.

## Wireframe
This is the wireframe that i did for desktop, mobile and tablet. It shows my explanation on how i want my game to be displayed.

## Features

The game will consist of 14 cards with the title above and time below the cards. 
 
### Existing Features
- Cards- it allows the users to click and see what the card reveals. 
- Time- it allows the users to check how much time he/she needs to complete the game.

## Future Feautures
- As a returning user, I want the game to have music.
- As a returning user, I want the game to have a popup.
- As a returning user, i want time to stop when i complete the game.
- As a returning user, I want to play the game again but with buttons.
- As a returning user, I want to be able to get some scores.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### As a user, I want to be able to click all the cards.
The user will be introduced with two sets of cards where he/she will be
able to click the card that he/she reveals

### As a user, I want to be able to get some scores.
If the user click on the card and matches with another card, he/she
will definitely get a score

### As a user, I want to be able to see how much time did i match my cards.
The time will be displayed for the user and the user will be able to check
how much time he/she has left

### As a user, I want to play the game again.
The user can play the game again by reloading the browser.

### As a user, i want to understand easily about the functionality of the game.
The user will be able to understand the game and it will help the user to know where
the cards are and if they match or not

## Further Testing
- I add jquery to better simplify and adjust my codes.
- I want my functions to work correctly without any bugs. I decided to create a condition where each
card has been defined. So l defined them as "firstClick". Therefore i want to make sure that if the cards match,
they wont flip back and if the cards do not match, they flip back.
- I tested the game with Google Chrome, Microsoft Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.
- I tested the game using different devices using my IPad and my IPhone.

### Bug
I have encountered so many bugs in my game but i did my best to fix them as much as possible:
- The functions were complicated to solve the problem but i have made some changes for each
function to work.
- I removed the check function because it was not actually checking the cards properly.
- I fixed the matched function to actually check if the cards match.
- I fixed the unmatched function to actually check if the cards do not match.
- I was able to fix time but unfortunately when i finish the game, it continues to go on.
- I used lockBoard to fix the bug for the memory board game. 
- Every time i click the card fast, the card will move and you will have to wait until the
card flips back.
